I'm hulb in Shanghai China. And I'm trying to become a good engineer. 

But sometimes I feel bored about coding also.

Life is short, what's the most important? 

- develop with golang, python
- handful experience for web backend development
- intereted in many: iot, activitypub, telegram bot, rss...
